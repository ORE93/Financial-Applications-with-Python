# Module 2 Challenge

This is the 2nd Module Challenge from my SMU Fintech Bootcamp. It is a loan qualifier application that will recieve a users inputs and then let them know if they qualify for a loan.

## Technologies

This application was created using the python coding language in the Visual Studio Code application on my Windows PC.

---

## Usage

To use this application you should run the python file "app.py" in your terminal, it will ask you to provide a path to the "daily_rate_sheet" where the loan information is stored, after answering the personal questions about your credit score, debt, etc. the app will tell you how many loans qualify for, if none, then you will be exited. If you do have qualfying loans however, you will be asked if you want to save them, if you say yes then you will be asked to provide a path to save the csv file. After providing the path and naming your csv file at the end of it, it will be available on your local machine so you can see the exact loans you qualified for.
