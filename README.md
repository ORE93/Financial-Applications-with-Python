# Financial Application with Python
This is the 2nd Module Challenge from my SMU Fintech Bootcamp. It is a loan qualifier application that will recieve a users inputs and then let them know if they qualify for a loan.

## Background
You’re progressing in your role as an application developer at a fintech lending startup. The lending software that you’ve built so far has been a big success for the company. As part of that success, you’ve been meeting a lot with the Business Operations (BizOps) team to discuss creating additional useful features.

At a recent meeting, a new, high-priority feature request emerged. Specifically, BizOps wants to know if your software can prompt the user to save the qualifying loans as a new CSV file.

This project is a fantastic way to show off your new software engineering skills as you advance in your fintech career.

## What You're Creating
You’ll apply software-engineering best practices to add new features and enhancements to the loan qualifier application. Specifically, you'll create a GitHub repository that includes all of the following files:

The primary application file, app.py

A data folder that contains the CSV file your application uses

A qualifier folder that contains all of the functions imported into the main app, organized into two subfolders:

filters, which includes .py files for all of your filter functions

utils, which includes your financial calculator module and your fileio module

A README.md file that explains the purpose of the project and how to use the code

A text file that shows your command history, demonstrating that you used version control best practices

As you move through the Challenge, keep in mind the user story and acceptance criteria that apply to each task.

## Technologies

This application was created using the python coding language in the Visual Studio Code application on my Windows PC.

---

## Usage

To use this application you should run the python file "app.py" in your terminal, it will ask you to provide a path to the "daily_rate_sheet" where the loan information is stored, after answering the personal questions about your credit score, debt, etc. the app will tell you how many loans qualify for, if none, then you will be exited. If you do have qualfying loans however, you will be asked if you want to save them, if you say yes then you will be asked to provide a path to save the csv file. After providing the path and naming your csv file at the end of it, it will be available on your local machine so you can see the exact loans you qualified for.
